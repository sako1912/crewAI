**2. Preparation Instructions:**

*Bulgogi:*  
1. In a bowl, combine soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, garlic, grated onion, sesame seeds, and black pepper. Mix well.  
2. Add the sliced beef and chopped green onions to the marinade. Mix until the beef is well-coated.  
3. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or overnight for more flavor.  
4. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the marinated beef and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Add julienned carrot if using, and stir-fry for an additional 2 minutes.  

*Kimchi Fried Rice:*  
1. Heat vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add chopped kimchi and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes.  
2. Add the kimchi juice, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Stir to combine.  
3. Add the cooked rice and stir-fry for another 5 minutes, ensuring the rice is well-mixed with the kimchi.  
4. In a separate pan, fry the eggs sunny-side up.  
5. Serve the fried rice topped with a fried egg and garnish with chopped green onions.  

*Cucumber Salad (Oi Muchim):*  
1. Place the sliced cucumbers in a bowl and sprinkle with salt. Let sit for 15 minutes, then drain excess water.  
2. In a small bowl, combine gochugaru, rice vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, garlic, and sesame seeds. Mix well.  
3. Pour the dressing over the cucumbers and toss to combine.  

**3. Serving Suggestions:**

- Arrange the bulgogi on a serving platter, garnished with extra sesame seeds and green onions.  
- Serve the kimchi fried rice alongside the bulgogi, with the fried egg on top for each portion.  
- Place the cucumber salad in a separate bowl as a refreshing side dish.  
- For a complete Korean dining experience, consider serving with additional side dishes like steamed rice, seaweed soup, or Korean pancakes (jeon).
