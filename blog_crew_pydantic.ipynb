      "While blockbusters “Dune: Part Two” and “Inside Out 2” rode the coattails of their prequels to become the top two highest grossing movies so far this year, a much greater list of Hollywood hopefuls failed to perform in the U.S., including thrillers, horrors and comedies.\n",

      "Among the major flops were several big-budget action movies, including “Madame Web,” the poorly reviewed Sydney Sweeney and Dakota Johnson superhero feature with a reported $80 million budget, and Universal Pictures’ “Argylle,” which fell just out the top 10 list after grossing $45.21 million despite a reported $200 million budget.\n",

      "Key Background\n",
      "2024 has been a rough year for Hollywood studios still recovering from the Covid-era box office doldrums, especially as streaming platforms increasingly compete with theaters. Comscore media analyst Paul Dergarabedian said last month he believes this summer’s box office gross could fall $800 million below last summer, which raked in over $4 billion—the most since the pandemic. Last year’s Hollywood writers’ and actors’ strikes also stunted the summer box office, pushing the release date of several major films from 2024 to 2025, notably Paramount’s upcoming sequel to its “Mission: Impossible” franchise.\n",
      "Tangent\n",
      "Kevin Costner’s “Horizon: An American Saga — Chapter 1,” the long-awaited first installment of Costner’s western epic, grossed just over $11 million from its June 28 release through June 30, according to Box Office Mojo. While that performance would put it second on the list of worst-performing movies of the first half of the year, it does not appear on the list because it has only been in theaters for a single weekend, and its domestic gross is expected to grow from its underwhelming start.\n",
      "What To Watch For\n",
      "Several major releases out last month are expected to become some of the highest-grossing movies of the year, including Disney and Pixar’s “Inside Out 2,” which boasted a $155 million U.S. opening—the biggest since “Barbie”—and Will Smith’s “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,” which posted an impressive $56 million in its opening weekend last month, far surpassing expectations. Other upcoming releases include Eddie Murphy’s “Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” (July 3), horror “MaXXXine” (July 5), “Fly Me to the Moon” (July 12), “Twisters” (July 19) and “Deadpool and Wolverine” (July 26).\n",

      "The 2024 box office has come with a lot of surprises. Sure, we knew the Pixar sequel Inside Out 2 would do well, but nobody could've predicted the records it shattered. The success of Deadpool & Wolverine was a bit more expected, but even that film surpassed previous R-rated movie achievements in record time. Each year a cohort of cinephiles bemoan the drying up of the film industry and each year a handful of films prove that the cinema is still very much alive.\n",
      "Then there are other films that feed right into the worry that, \"people just don't go to the theaters anymore.\" Madame Web was trashed by critics and audiences and barely eked out ticket sales over its budget. Horizon: An American Saga — Chapter 1 released to lukewarm reception and earned just over half its budget.\n",
      "Most would agree that these box-office bombs deserved these lackluster results. However, others perhaps weren't given a fair shot. Here are 10 that deserve a second look.\n",
      "10 Lisa Frankenstein 4/5 Lisa Frankenstein Release Date February 9, 2024 Director Zelda Williams Cast Kathryn Newton , Cole Sprouse , Carla Gugino , Jenna Davis , Joe Chrest Main Genre Comedy \n",
      "Lisa Frankenstein is the directorial debut of Zelda Williams, daughter of the late and beloved actor Robin Williams. Set in the late '80s, it follows a teenager named Lisa who's a recluse still coming to terms with her mom's gruesome murder. After being assaulted at a party, Lisa goes to her safe space, which happens to be the local cemetery. There, when a bolt of lightning strikes, an unconventional relationship begins.\n",
      " In the Original's Shadow? \n",
      "This film was penned by Diablo Cody, the same screenwriter behind Jennifer's Body. Cody claims both movies are part of the same cinematic universe. With the resurgence of love for Jennifer's Body in recent years and a small budget of $13 million, Lisa Frankenstein should've been a moderate success. But it finished at just under $10 million at the box office.\n",
      "Like its predecessor, it's a bit campy and the humor doesn't land with everyone. Lisa Frankenstein may not have the same edge and quirkiness as Jennifer's Body, but it's a solid debut from Williams.\n",
      "Stream on Prime Video\n",
      " Related All 8 Movies That Broke $1 Billion at the Box Office Since Covid Though Covid took its toll on the industry, that didn't stop these films from exceeding expectations. \n",
      "9 Mothers’ Instinct Mothers' Instinct Release Date January 11, 2024 Director Benoît Delhomme Cast Anne Hathaway , Jessica Chastain , Josh Charles , Anders Danielsen Lie , Caroline Lagerfelt Runtime 1hr 34min Main Genre Drama \n",
      "Mothers' Instinct is the second film adaptation of the 2012 novel of the same name, following the 2018 French version. Here, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain star. The story revolves around Alice and Céline (Chastain and Hathaway) who are neighbors in the '60s. They have sons who are the same age and husbands who work a ton. Their routines are upended when a decision made by Alice leads to the death of Céline's son.\n",
      " A Non-Meandering Character Study \n",
      "Chastain and Hathaway both have producing credits on this movie and it's clear they were heavily invested in bringing this story to life. One second the viewer is siding with Céline, the next Alice, and the following neither of them. This story is guaranteed to spark discussion about who was truly at fault for the son's death, or if was a simple accident.\n",
      "While the exact budget hasn't been released, it's safe to say not topping $3 million was a disappointment. Mothers' Instinct theatrical release was short-lived, but it deserves a second life on streaming platforms.\n",
      "Rent on Apple TV\n",
      "8 The Fall Guy 4/5 The Fall Guy PG-13 The Fall Guy is an action thriller from Bullet Train and Deadpool 2 director David Leitch. Ryan Gosling stars as a stuntman who is forced to find a missing movie star, investigate a conspiracy, and repair his relationship with the love of his life. The film was written by Drew Pearce and inspired by the 1980s TV series of the same name. Release Date May 3, 2024 Director David Leitch Cast Ryan Gosling , Emily Blunt , Aaron Taylor-Johnson , Stephanie Hsu , Winston Duke , Hannah Waddingham , Teresa Palmer Runtime 126 Minutes Main Genre Action \n",
      "The Fall Guy is an action comedy starring Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt. Colt Seavers (Gosling) is a former stuntman who agrees to work on his ex-girlfriend Jody's (Blunt) directorial debut. Colt is shocked to learn that Jody didn't approve his hiring and that the film's lead actor, Tom Ryder, is missing.\n",
      "This was Gosling's first released project after the monster success of last year's Barbie. That, coupled with Blunt's star power and the increasing popularity of Aaron Taylor-Johnson (who played Tom), should've made this a hit.\n",
      " Too Loose with the Cash \n",
      "Perhaps this is yet another case of inflated budgets ruining a box office return before it had even a chance. There's no reason an action comedy needed a $125-150 million budget (it made $178 million). Bad Boys: Ride or Die, another 2024 release, capped its budget off at $100 million (with two veteran actors) and became one of the year's best-performing movies. All that aside, The Fall Guy is a fun movie that brings solid acting performances and deserves a watch when it comes to streaming.\n",

This film is a prequel and the origin story of one of the coolest characters in this world, Furiosa (played here by Anya Taylor-Joy). It starts showing Furiosa as a young, intelligent, and resourceful child and how she grew to hate the warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth). As she matures, her focus remains clear to take back what Dementus and his henchmen have stolen from her.\n",

Despite the niche appeal, Furiosa had a blockbuster-level budget of $168 million but made a little more than $172 million at the box office.\n",
