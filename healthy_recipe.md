- 1 tablespoon salt  
- 1 tablespoon gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes)

- 1 tablespoon soy sauce  
- 1 tablespoon sugar or a natural sweetener like stevia  
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil  
- 1 clove garlic, minced  
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds  

**2. Preparation Instructions:**

*Mushroom Bulgogi:*  
1. In a bowl, combine soy sauce, sesame oil, maple syrup, garlic, grated onion, sesame seeds, and black pepper. Mix well.  
2. Add the sliced mushrooms and chopped green onions to the marinade. Mix until the mushrooms are well-coated.  
3. Cover and let marinate for at least 30 minutes, or overnight for more flavor.  
4. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the marinated mushrooms and cook until tender and browned, about 5-7 minutes. Add julienned carrot if using, and stir-fry for an additional 2 minutes.  

*Kimchi Fried Rice:*  
1. Heat vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add chopped vegan kimchi and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes.  
2. Add the kimchi juice, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Stir to combine.  
3. Add the cooked brown rice and stir-fry for another 5 minutes, ensuring the rice is well-mixed with the kimchi.  
4. In the same pan, add the tofu strips and cook until golden brown on each side.  
5. Serve the fried rice with tofu strips on top and garnish with chopped green onions.  

*Cucumber Salad (Oi Muchim):*  
1. Place the sliced cucumbers in a bowl and sprinkle with salt. Let sit for 15 minutes, then drain excess water.  
2. In a small bowl, combine gochugaru, rice vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, garlic, and sesame seeds. Mix well.  
3. Pour the dressing over the cucumbers and toss to combine.  

**3. Serving Suggestions:**

- Arrange the mushroom bulgogi on a serving platter, garnished with extra sesame seeds and green onions.  
- Serve the kimchi fried rice alongside the bulgogi, topped with the golden tofu strips for each portion.  
- Place the cucumber salad in a separate bowl as a refreshing side dish.  
- For a complete Korean dining experience, consider serving with additional side dishes like steamed brown rice, miso soup, or vegetable pancakes (jeon).  

**4. Explanation of the Replaced Ingredients:**

- **Beef to Mushrooms:** I replaced beef with portobello or shiitake mushrooms to maintain a meaty texture while making the dish vegetarian.  
- **Sugar to Maple Syrup:** Used maple syrup or agave syrup as a healthier alternative to sugar, adding a unique flavor.  
- **White Rice to Brown Rice:** Brown rice is used instead of white rice for added fiber and nutrients.  
- **Eggs to Tofu:** Tofu strips replace eggs, providing protein and a satisfying texture.  
- **Kimchi to Vegan Kimchi:** Vegan kimchi is used to avoid fish sauce or shrimp paste often found in traditional kimchi, making it suitable for vegetarians.  

This Korean dinner is not only delicious but also healthy and easy to prepare at home, offering authentic flavors with a vegetarian twist. Enjoy your meal!
