      "Hot Sauce Market Trends: How Gen Z is Redefining Hot Sauce Culture\n",
      "Hot sauce can be a polarizing topic: some can’t eat it while others can’t go without it – to the point where they even bring it to restaurants. Among hot sauce enthusiasts, this topping is more than a condiment, it’s a culture. \n",
      "As Americans make homemade hot sauce, test the limits of their taste buds, and try artisanal hot sauce, one generation seems to be fueling this trend: Gen Z. In a survey of over 1,000 Americans about consumer hot sauce habits and preferences, we found Gen Z really stands out.  While 34% of Americans consider themselves “hot sauce connoisseurs,” over half (51%) of Gen Zers classify themselves as one. \n",
      "Five Reasons People Eat Hot Sauce \n",
      "Ninety-three percent of Americans eat hot sauce, but their tolerance varies. A bold 9% say they can eat anything as hot as possible, and 31% can handle hot flavors. Meanwhile, 33% say their limit is medium, while 20% can handle mild and nothing more. \n",
      "One generation is leading the charge when it comes to hot sauce: Gen Z. While 21% of Americans have been willing to sign a waiver to eat something with hot sauce, 35% of Gen Z have done the same. Their presence on social media could be a key driver. Over one in three (34%) Zoomers have tried a social media-inspired hot sauce challenge. \n",
      "One respondent called hot sauce her “entire life” saying: \n",
      "“I would eat hot sauce any day. It is a great conversation starter. I also really like Hot Ones and made my own Hot Ones challenge.”\n",
      "Over half (51%) of Americans use hot sauce more than once a week. People are drawn to hot sauce for five common reasons: \n",
      "Enjoy the taste\n",
      "Feel it adds depth to the dish\n",
      "Enjoy the sensation of heat\n",
      "Grew up eating hot or spicy foods\n",
      "Like to customize the heat level of their meals \n",
      "However, all this hot sauce comes with a physical price. Over two in three (68%) say it causes them to have a runny nose, and some end up sweating, crying, or even dealing with some digestive issues. But some Americans are hoping for that physical reaction when eating hot sauce. Nearly one in four – 23% – say they eat it just to clear their sinuses. \n",
      "“Swicy” Food and Drink Trend\n",
      "While sweet and spicy food isn’t a new concept, the word “swicy” is a new trendy term being used in marketing. Searches for the word on Google have increased 1,700% from March 2023 to March 2024 (the latest data available from Google at the time of this report), and three in four Americans say they would be willing to try swicy food or drinks. \n",
      "Although a bold 37% of Americans would try a taste of the hottest pepper in the world, younger generations have a greater desire to test their taste buds. Sixty percent of Gen Z and 47% of Millennials said they’d try a bite.\n",
      "Go-To Hot Sauces\n",
      "People are passionate about the hot sauces that they use. About one in four Millennials and Gen Z bring their own hot sauce to restaurants rather than run the risk of not having it for their meal. \n",
      "When it comes to buying hot sauce, 51% consider Scoville units before making a purchase. Scoville units are the measurement of how hot a pepper is rated. Over three in five (62%) are more likely to buy something if it’s advertised as hot or spicy. \n",
      "People mainly buy hot sauce from the grocery store, but 14% get it at local farmers markets. While the majority of Americans stick with traditional hot sauce brands, over one in 10 (12%) like to have artisanal hot sauces. Overall, the go-to hot sauce brands people prefer are: \n",
      "TABASCO® \n",
      "Frank’s RedHot®\n",
      "Cholula®\n",
      "Louisiana Hot Sauce\n",
      "Texas Pete® \n",
      "The majority of Americans prefer to douse hot sauce on tacos, chicken wings, or burritos. Around the U.S. though, certain regions put it on different foods. Those living in the South are more partial to putting hot sauce on seafood or soups and stews. In the Northeast, mac and cheese, fried rice, and hamburgers are more commonly eaten with hot sauce. Out West, people try hot sauce with their burritos and eggs. \n",
      "While one in 10 Americans who are over 21 prefer to sip something alcoholic while eating something with hot sauce, the majority prefer to drink something non-alcoholic. Most drink water followed by soda or milk. \n",
      "Top 5 Favorite Cuisines Known for Their Spice\n",
      "Hot sauce culture drives a desire for spice that extends outside of sauce. Americans enjoy a variety of spicy foods from around the world with three in four consumers specifically enjoying cuisines known for their spice. The top cuisines Americans enjoy include Mexican, Chinese/Szechuan, Spanish, Thai and Indian. \n",
      "The places where people live and grow up can strongly influence their hot sauce habits. In fact, 19% of those living in the South and 18% of those in the West say they eat hot sauce with their food because they live in a place with a lot of hot and spicy food.\n",
      "While one in three attribute their high tolerance for hot sauce to their hometowns or places they currently live, 27% credit cultural or social influences for their tolerance. More than half of Asian and Hispanic survey respondents say cultural or social influences have made eating hot sauce easier. \n",
      "One respondent shared his grandmother was Sicilian and that she loved eating hot sauce, so he does too. Another respondent had this to say:\n",
      "“It pairs really well with soda, in my opinion, and it is a part of a lot of my culture’s traditional foods. It’s just really delicious.” \n",
      "Nearly one in 10 (9%) prefer to make hot sauce themselves. Slightly more Hispanic and Asian respondents shared they make homemade hot sauce than the average American. \n",
      "Reasons People Don’t Eat Hot Sauce\n",
      "Hot sauce isn’t for everyone. There are five main reasons people don’t eat hot sauce:\n",
      "Don’t like spicy food\n",
      "Don’t like the burning feeling\n",
      "Digestive sensitivities \n",
      "Low spice tolerance\n",
      "Didn’t grow up eating hot/spicy food. \n",
      "While most Americans still choose hot sauce as their number one condiment, the other top condiment is ketchup. Among all the generations, baby boomers were the only ones to choose ketchup as their top condiment over hot sauce. More women than men also prefer ketchup to hot sauce.\n",
      "According to NCSolutions purchase data, in the first three months of 2024, mayonnaise was the top condiment purchased by consumers. Hot sauce/chili condiments were the second most popular purchase followed by ketchup, mustard, and soy sauce. Interestingly, the end of the year appears to be a more popular time for hot sauce purchases. In 2023, the biggest months for buying hot sauce were December, October, and November.\n",
      "At the end of the day, everyone needs a little spice in their life. At least, that’s what one survey respondent said when we asked them why they like hot sauce. Whether you prefer to spice up your life by eating something with hot sauce or maybe just eating something new, we hope you continually find new flavorful food and drinks.\n",
      "About the Consumer Sentiment Survey\n",
      "The consumer sentiment survey of 1,114 Americans was commissioned by NCSolutions in April and May 2024 and was made up of U.S. adults ages 18+, who were asked about their eating habits and preferences. Results were weighted to be representative of the U.S. population by age, gender, region, ethnicity, marital status, education level, and household income.\n",
      "About the NCS Purchase Data\n",
      "NCS provides purchase insights to brands to help them optimize, measure, and enable sales-based outcomes.NCS’s representative and balanced consumer CPG purchase data set consists of the industry’s preeminent and comprehensive sources. It is inclusive of actual purchase data (transaction information) from big-box retailers, supermarkets, drug stores, convenience stores and other retail channels through which American households buy CPG products spanning 340+ grocery categories.

      "Randy Shropshire/Getty Images for Sonic Desert\n",
      "New York\n",
      "CNN\n",
      "  — \n",
      " Americans should prepare for a sizzling hot summer, and not just because of rising temperatures.\n",
      " Consumers are bravely opening their palate to bolder, spicier, more fiery flavors and the marketplace for foods and drinks is happily obliging them.\n",
      " Walk into a Walmart, Target, a corner 7-Eleven, pretty much any food store lately that sells packaged food and it’s hard to miss. The snack aisle has gotten spicier.\n",
      " “The spicy trend is here to stay,” Sally Lyons Wyatt, packaged goods and foodservice industry advisor with market research firm Circana, said in an interview with CNN.\n",
      " From chips, popcorn, burgers to ice cream, frozen pizza, alcohol, Starbucks drinks to Coca-Cola, a growing variety of foods and beverage brands are punching up their offerings by adding the spice, bold “swicy” flavor or outright heat.\n",
      " “My whole motto for a couple of years has been, ‘The hotter the better,’ because consumers gravitate to it. Traditionally it was younger consumers that were driving this but now we’ve seen bold flavors being embraced by most age groups but the dominant are still younger consumers,” Lyons Wyatt said.\n",
      " The segment of the population firing up demand for fiery flavors, she said, includes younger Millennials, Gen Z and the youngest cohort, Gen Alpha.\n",
      "The Coca-Cola Company\n",
      "Related article\n",
      "Coke’s first new permanent flavor in years adds a spicy twist\n",
      " While it might seem as though we’re surrounded by spiciness in every grocery aisle lately, the start of this trend goes back at least a decade and is well established with spicy flavors in snacking, she said.\n",
      " “But the proliferation of spiciness across different categories, like beverages, that part is relatively new,” Lyons said.\n",
      " To her point, Coca-Cola in February launched its first new permanent soda flavor addition in years. The flavor it chose: Coca-Cola Spiced. The company told CNN that its own research had surfaced an “increase in consumer willingness to try a spiced beverage” and “more bold flavors and more complex flavor profiles” both in food and beverages.\n",
      " The soda giant described the new drink as a blend of the traditional Coke flavor with raspberry and spiced flavors and said it would be available in both full sugar and zero-sugar varieties.\n",
      " First comes spice, then comes “swicy”\n",
      "Starbucks in April came out with a new limited-time spiced up line of its lemonade drinks in three flavors — Spicy Dragonfruit, Spicy Pineapple and Spicy Strawberry, which it said are inspired by the “swicy” trend of creatively combining sweet and spicy flavors.\n",
      " Spicy plus sweet give you “Swicy.” And yes, brands are trying to make it a thing as they look for ways to stretch out the spicy trend.\n",
      "Starbucks Reserve Hot Honey Affogato\n",
      "Starbucks\n",
      " It said the refreshers, targeting Gen Z and Millennials, are punched up by adding Starbucks’ spicy chili powder blend to the concoctions. Starbucks in the spring also introduced limited-time hot honey drinks, made with wildflower honey infused with chili peppers, such as Hot Honey Affogato and Hot Honey Espresso Martini to the menu at its Starbucks Reserve roasteries and stores in the US.\n",
      " “I think we are going to see a lot more of this,” said Lyons Wyatt. “There is a push now and we do see both unit and dollar growth of spicy and swicy products.”\n",
      " Younger, diverse America is spicier\n",
      " According to Circana, dollar sales for food and beverages with “spicy” in the description has increased 9% year-over-year.\n",
      " Circana’s latest data also found that 11% of 25 to 34-year-olds enjoy bold and unexpected flavors, up 7 percentage points from 2019 and that 11% of 18 to 34-year-olds enjoy bold and unexpected flavors, up 4.7 percentage points from 2019.\n",
      " Shifting demographics is a big driver for bolder flavor experimentation, industry experts said.\n",
      " The United States has become more racially and ethnically diverse, and as such, sees widening access to more global ingredients and dishes, Jennifer Creevy, director of food and drink at trend forecasting and analytics firm WGSN, said in an interview with CNN.\n",
      "Gochugaru-marinated shrimp on a potato roll with kimchi slaw, gochujang mayonnaise and spicy pickle spear available at Sonoma Terrace during Lunar New Year at Disney California Adventure in Anaheim, California.\n",
      "Jeff Gritchen/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register/Getty Images\n",
      " “The younger generations, Gen Z and Gen Alpha, are also much more global in their outlook than previous generations. To them a chilli crisp or a salsa macha is as much a regular condiment as say a mayo or ketchup,” Creevy said.\n",
      " Increased globalization has also led to more culturally-diverse music, entertainment and gaming become the norm, which in turn influences our food decisions, she said.\n",
      " “Take the rise of K-Drama and K-Pop as an example. Fans of this entertainment want to consume the media but also want to taste the flavors of Korea, hence the rise of spicy Gochujang, which is now in everything from dishes to snacks, drinks and desserts,” she said. Gochujang, a red chili paste, is a popular Korean condiment.\n",
      "Footlong Cookies have returned to menus nationwide following months of incredible demand.\n",
      "Subway\n",
      "Related article\n",
      "Subway is bringing back the footlong cookie after it disappeared for four months\n",
      " Interest is also growing for Vietnamese and African cuisine over the last four years, according to global market research firm Mintel.\n",
      " The pandemic, too, has been an important accelerator of the popularity of spice.\n",
      " “During the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, consumers could not travel and so yearned to taste the cuisines of faraway places,” Creevy said. “This, coupled with consumers becoming more confident in the kitchen has led to more adventurous tastes.\n",
      " Can our taste buds handle spice as we age?\n",
      " The longevity of spicy and swicy will depend on how committed consumers are to sticking with these flavors as they grow older.\n",
      " “Our tastebuds change as we age. So I’m hesitant to say that it is for everyone all through your life,” said Lyons Wyatt. “It is being fueled by the younger generation, and enjoyed by all generations, just not at the same degree.”\n",
      " Expect spiciness to expand to other food categories, too. “More sweet and spicy in confections, in frozen goods, in deli products and more in pizza varieties through the sauces,” she said.\n",
      "Nestlé Tombstone tavern-style pizza\n",
      "Nestlé USA\n",
      " Pepsico, which owns the spicy Flamin’ Hot snack and beverage brand, told CNN that in 2023, shoppers in North America made nearly 400 million trips to stores to purchase Flamin’ Hot products, up 31% from the previous year.\n",
      " “Flamin’ Hot is especially popular among younger, more adventurous consumers, who want that hit of intense experience with every bite,” said Mustafa Shamseldin, category growth officer and CMO, International Foods at Pepsico. “We’ve continued to cultivate the brand to satisfy the expectations of this group and consistently work to bring forward flavors that resonate — whether they’re looking big flavors with a hint of spice or a full blast of heat.”\n",
      " Nestlé USA, which owns the DiGiorno frozen pizza brand, told CNN it’s leaning into the trend with product innovations. Nestlé in the spring launched its DiGiorno Thin & Crispy Stuffed Crust Pepperoni Pizza with Mike’s Hot Honey. Nestlé also introduced the Tombstone taverrn-style pizza called “the Primo,” with pepperoni, sausage, banana peppers and red onion.\n",

      " Nestlé has also trotted out recent spicy innovations such as California Pizza Kitchen’s Hot Honey Croissant Crust Pizza, Stouffer’s Spicy Nacho Mac and Hot Pockets x Hot Ones.\n",
      " “I’d like to challenge the perception that the American palate was ever bland to begin with: red pepper flakes have always been a core part of the pizza experience,” said Varchasvi Singh, food service analyst with Mintel.\n",
      " “Americans have made cult-favorites out of condiments like Sriracha and hot honey. But there certainly is an expanded appetite for spicy foods and flavors, one that is driven by wanting to explore unfamiliar ingredients and cuisines,” Singh said. “This enthusiasm isn’t a fad, it is here to stay.”\n",

      "\n",
      "7. **Unique Taste Test Format**: Instead of a traditional taste test, create a storyline or theme that the taste test fits into, such as a \"Swicy Adventure\" where each sauce is a stop on a global journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Include a Rating System**: Develop a unique and fun rating system for the sauces, possibly incorporating humor or entertainment, to make the taste test more engaging.\n",

If a shopper is focused on health and wellness? He or she will likely be drawn to “wellness flavors” like blueberry, citrus, green tea, hojicha (Japanese roasted green tea), elderberry, and turmeric, says Philip Caputo, marketing and consumer insights manager at Virginia Dare (Brooklyn, NY).If the goal is indulgence, or nostalgia or adventure, there’s a flavor for that as well. Ahead, experts from leading flavor houses predict which flavors will trend, and why.Health and WellnessHealth remains a leading driver of CPG purchases. The food, drink, and dietary supplements market is no different. Jen Lyons, marketing manager at Sensient Flavors & Extracts (Hoffman Estates, IL), describes this movement as “better for all of me, mind and body.”“Consumers want more than ever for their food and beverages to do more for their body than just nourish; they want them to align with their overall health goals, whether that is heart health, gut health, or energy and stress relief,” she continues. Flavors associated with wellness often stem from florals and herbs, such as honeysuckle, dandelion, bergamot, and guayusa, she notes.Wellness today is more nuanced than ever, says Virginia Dare’s Caputo. This has opened doors for many types of health-related products and flavors. “Wellness flavors encompass much more than immunity,” he explains. “We divide them further into ‘moodfluencers,’ beautifiers, and body boosters. ‘Moodfluencers’ promote relaxation or focus, like chamomile honeysuckle tea. Beautifiers highlight beauty-from-within and frequently feature fresh, crisp flavors like orange thyme pomelo. Body boosters include [flavors for] immunity support, anti-inflammatory, or digestive health, like ginger guava.”Flavors for Plant-Based ProductsPlant-based products are in demand, and work continues to solve any taste problems associated with plant-based ingredients.Flavorchem’s 2024 Flavor & Trend Forecast reports identifies plant-based as a leading trend. “The next wave of plant-based innovation will extend beyond conventional alternatives, incorporating novel ingredients, formats, and functionality,” the report states. “Significant strides have been made in ingredient innovation to overcome plant-based taste challenges and improve sensory attributes.”FlavorSum’s director of marketing, Lisa Jackson, adds that “Plant-based protein alternatives continue to widen as brands strive to deliver the endurance benefits that more than 4 in 5 North Americans want from foods and beverages. Flavors and flavor modulators that complement emerging plant-based proteins like hemp or algae are essential to meeting taste expectations.”Citrus flavors have long signaled wellness, especially immune and digestive health, says ADM’s Zhou. “With functionality now a baseline expectation of the wellness crowd, citrus fulfills the perception of health as well as delivering on crisp, refreshing taste,” she says. “Yuzu and blood orange have gone mainstream, and flavors to watch include pomelo, finger lime, and bitter orange.”“Bright and zesty” citrus flavors also stand for hydration, energy, and mental stimulation, Zhou says, giving examples like ruby red grapefruit energy drinks, calamansi gummy supplements, or mango-tangelo sparkling water.Lisa Jackson, director of marketing at FlavorSum LLC (Kalamazoo, MI), sees similar trends. Tropical fruits, for instance, rule the energy market. “Energy remains a top priority for North Americans, but they want more support than a caffeinated four-to-six-hour boost,” she says. “FlavorSum’s proprietary research shows people want adaptogenic benefits from ingredients like L-theanine and Ginkgo biloba to help with mood and cognitive function without the jitters. Named by North Americans as the flavor family most likely to generate news in 2024, tropical fruits cue energy with pairings that include pineapple or passion fruit flavors.”She adds that “Citrus flavor predictions for 2023 materialized, and we expect popularity to continue in 2024, with more complex or globally inspired flavors, like star fruit or tangor, gaining momentum.” This trend extends beyond beverages, where citrus flavors were already common, to foods like dairy, frozen desserts, cereals, cookies, and bars.Floral FlavorsFloral flavors also denote wellness—and add an air of sophistication. “Consumers continue to prioritize relaxation, seeking peace, calmness, tranquility, and sweet dreams,” says Megan Byrnes, marketing manager for Gold Coast Ingredients (Commerce, CA). “As additional mood-support supplements and beverages enter the nutraceutical industry, we plan to see more flavors like lavender, chamomile, and passion flower, oftentimes paired with vanilla, peach, berry, and citrus flavors.”In its 2024 Top Beverage Trends report, flavor supplier Flavorman (Louisville, KY) cites the popularity of floral notes in the drinks market. “Reflecting on its 2023 predictions, Flavorman accurately foresaw the rise of floral flavor profiles like elderflower and lavender alongside the continued popularity of fruity twists such as pineapple and mango. These soothing and tropical flavor classes gained traction in the manufacturing space…”Hydration DrinksHydration drinks are on the rise, resulting in a new host of nuanced flavors to delight and surprise customers.“Summer fruit flavors are blooming in the recent hydration revolution,” notes Alex Massumoto, marketing specialist at Synergy Flavors. “Nearly one-third of powdered hydration drinks carry citrus flavors.” Today’s rising flavors include passion fruit, lemon lime, and pink lemonade, reports Synergy Flavors’ Hydration Revolution report.“As the category continues to grow, we expect to see new summery and emerging flavors, including kiwi, peach, pomegranate, apple, acai, dragon fruit, and yuzu,” he adds.Consumers also want natural ingredients in their hydration drinks, says Lisa Jackson, director of marketing at FlavorSum. She notes that more than 7 in 10 consumers in North America consider hydration drinks a top choice for refreshment. “While many name electrolytes as a top solution for hydration,” she adds, “50% or more say ingredients and flavors like watermelon or coconut suggest a more natural option.”And Zhou at ADM states that “Florals, especially cherry blossom, lavender, and violet, are frequently associated with calming tea beverages and baked goods, and they can elevate gummies.”She adds: “Cherry blossoms and leaves are often pickled to preserve and concentrate the flavor, which creates a delightful sweet and salty taste sensation. A savory option is sakura senbei, toasted rice crackers flavored with cherry blossom and salted leaves.”Honeysuckle is on the rise as a floral ingredient, Byrnes points out. “Botanical flavors such as hibiscus, lavender, and rose have become common in the food and beverage industries,” she says. “We are now starting to see honeysuckle as an innovative ingredient. Keep an eye out for honeysuckle flavor and pairings like honeysuckle citrus and honeysuckle raspberry.”Hibiscus, jasmine, violet, and elderflower also add a touch of novelty, says Virginia Dare’s Caputo. “Even as a top note,” he says, “flavors like lavender transform the taste and experience of an application by instantly adding class and complexity. Or, you can lean into a charmingly homespun take focused on handcrafted, earthy flavor notes, like rosemary brown butter cookies.”Fermented and PickledConsumers also link fermented flavors with health benefits, and demand is growing. “Funky and fermented flavors are trending with the growth of pickling, vinegars, and kombucha,” says ADM’s Zhou. “Sour notes provide an unexpected twist to functional food and drink products, like balsamic berry and pickled grapes, which may also cue consumer awareness of the importance of digestive health.”Byrnes at Gold Coast Ingredients also predicts popularity of pickled flavors. She notes: “We’ve been watching the boom in dill pickle flavor in chips, snacks, condiments, and dips. We foresee dill pickle and spicy dill pickle flavors moving into nutritional products like protein chips, snacks, sauces, and even beverages.”Spicy Meets SweetSpicy flavors have been on the rise for years, and 2024 will be no different. “Specialty global chili and pepper varieties such as scorpion pepper, gochujang, and harissa are heating up in global launches,” Flavorchem’s (Downers Grove, IL) 2024 Flavor & Trend Forecast report states.Next year, expect to see an increase in flavors combining both spicy and sweet notes.Over at Synergy Flavors (Wauconda, IL), Marketing Specialist Alex Massumoto says that “as brands look for unique flavor innovation that pushes the boundaries, savory and sweet combinations will become more present. Flavors like smokey vanilla, chocolate sriracha, mango habanero, and chili pineapple will offer consumers a break from the traditional flavors.”Cooking-InspiredFlavors used in home cooking are on the rise. “Due to consumers being forced to cook at home and be mindful of their spending, there’s a newfound passion for cooking and diverse techniques,” says Jen Lyons, marketing manager at Sensient Flavors & Extracts.What does this mean for flavors? “I anticipate the rise of cooking-process flavors in upcoming product launches,” she predicts. “While caramelized onion and brown butter have gained traction, envision innovations like a char-grilled chicken-flavored cracker or a cast iron cookie. By using a flavor to get those culinary notes in manufactured products, you will pique the interest of the rising home cook stars.”Spicy is also merging with fruity, says Byrnes at Gold Coast Ingredients. “The sweet heat trend continues, so keep your eyes open for innovative chili and fruit pairings,” she advises. “Mango chili, watermelon chili, and pineapple chili have proven successful in the marketplace. Next contenders are grapefruit chili, kiwi chili, and strawberry chili.”Flavorman likewise notes in its 2024 Top Beverage Trends report that “sweet heat fusions” blending fruity and spicy flavors will be a leading movement in 2024. “Whether it’s a mango habanero pressed juice or a zesty spicy margarita, for example, consumers can expect more ‘sweet heat’ fusions in 2024,” the company’s press release states.Sweet spices also remain popular. “Spice in the sweet sense—cinnamon sugar, clove, ginger, cardamom, nutmeg, allspice, cocoa, star anise, and vanilla—provides a tasty treat for consumers seeking a moment of enjoyment in their busy day,” says ADM’s Zhou. Sweet spices are also gaining traction in sports nutrition products, she says, with examples like a cinnamon-roll protein shake or a high-fiber bar flavored with cardamom, blueberry, and lemon.SweetOf course, sweet flavors remain heavy hitters. “Decadent dessert profiles featuring strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate will remain in fashion as brands look to elevate their current portfolio,” Flavorchem’s 2024 Flavor & Trend Forecast states.In its 2024 Top Beverage Trends report, Flavorman says “the company notes an increasing demand for indulgent flavors such as sugar cookies and brownies, all while maintaining a focus on health-conscious formulations.” It’s not unusual to see low-calorie labels on products touting flavors like red velvet, sugar cookies, brownies, and other pastries, for instance.Consumers are also seeking healthier sources of sweet flavor and are drawn to “natural” fruits and other ingredient pairings. “Natural nuttiness and sweetness are gaining traction, especially as consumers lean into authenticity, which is important for taste replication,” says Zhou at ADM. “Overly artificial flavors of the past are being surpassed by flavors that taste more natural and convincing.” Examples include “mildly nutty” pistachio, crisp cucumber, and sweet melons like cantaloupe and honeydew.Caramelized fruits are also trending in the sweet category. Says Zhou: “Caramelized fruits like banana, apple, and strawberry offer a celebration of hedonistic tastes and an opportunity for luxe self-expression. Stone fruits also play well in this space, including apricots, peaches, and plums.” Tanghulu, a candied fruit skewer, is an example of a popular glazed-fruit dessert made with many types of fruit, including kiwi, peeled clementines, and raspberries, she points out.And sweet-savory combos remain popular. “Savory creations featuring profiles like maple, honey, bacon, and mango are creating upscale twists in new product categories,” says Flavorchem’s 2024 Flavor & Trend Forecast report.Blasts from the PastMany sweet flavors are reminiscent of childhood. Nostalgic flavors that bring back memories of happy times are an ongoing trend. At Virginia Dare, Caputo calls this trend “newstalgia.”“Consumers immediately connect with nostalgia, so flavors that can tap into positive emotions advertise themselves,” he says. “We love to reconnect with familiar favorites and reminisce about the fruity cereals we ate as a kid, eyes glued on our Saturday morning cartoons. Or the Orange Creamsicles enjoyed after chasing down the ice cream truck and quickly eaten before the summer heat got to it.” Nostalgic flavors like S’mores, cotton candy, caramel apple, and funnel cake can also be used as flavors in new applications like cocktails.Childhood favorites also include “imaginative flavors like unicorn and rainbow,” points out Byrnes at Gold Coast Ingredients.Artificial IntelligenceCan AI help formulators develop new flavors? Indeed it can, according to Flavorchem’s 2024 Flavor & Trend Forecast.The report notes: “The food industry is experiencing rapid transformation as artificial intelligence revolutionizes the way that brands and manufacturers operate. AI helps brands develop new products by analyzing data from flavor, menu, and market trends.”Flavorchem’s 2024 Flavor & Trend Forecast report also describes how nostalgic flavors can be modernized, calling this “new nostalgia.” It states: “Classic comforts from childhood, such as PB&Js, S’mores, candy, and breakfast-based flavors, are resurging in elevated new formats,” including in products like coffee creamer.“Consumers’ cravings for nostalgic foods will significantly drive flavor innovation and new product development in the years ahead,” the report predicts.Memories of flavor are very personal. As FlavorSum’s Jackson points out, “Personalization can also occur through association with celebratory or seasonal events. We saw birthday cake and S’mores flavors emerge across the food and beverage landscape. Look for flavors like gingerbread, banana-boats, and orange brownie to expand as brands tap into tastes associated with happy memories.”Seasonal flavors remind consumers of happy times year-round. Jackson points out how seasonal flavors are evolving. “Although pumpkin spice will likely remain a fall and winter favorite, other seasonal favorites, like peach, will begin showing up year-round in foods and beverages….Tastewise reports conversations about ‘year-round seasons’ increased by 24% last year.”Seasonal flavors can also be given a modern spin, she adds. “Brands can turn to local or global fruit flavors like pawpaw, honey bell oranges, guavasteen, mangosteen, or cherimoya as a tactic for adding novelty to seasonal tastes.”Finally, melding classic flavors with unexpected ones can freshen up a standard. “These flavor combinations take a fan-favorite like vanilla and add something more sophisticated, like a vanilla lavender bundt cake,” Caputo says. “Elevated classics are rare, best-of-both-worlds combinations. They feel both safe and adventurous, and people are instantly drawn to new takes on their favorite flavors.” Examples include vanilla and black pepper, spicy Mexican chocolate, and strawberry matcha.Adventure AwaitsExploration, of course, is still on the menu. Many consumers are eager to broaden their horizons and discover unfamiliar and global flavors. As Flavorchem’s 2024 Flavor & Trend Forecast states, “The hottest menu trends poised for 2024 will offer consumers novel taste experiences, allowing exploration of new dishes, ingredients, and flavors.”International flavors are finding new fans in far-off corners of the world thanks to the globalization of technology. “Flavors from across the world catch everyday consumer attention with the globalization of flavor palates through viral social media and FoodTok trends, extending into in-person experiences everywhere, from fine dining to street food,” says ADM’s Zhou. “People are expanding the geographic boundaries of their taste buds and transcending the traditional in favor of contrast and complexity. Consumers are experimenting with foods, beverages, and dietary supplements in a broad variety of flavors, such as crimson tea made with cranberries, redcurrant, and rooibos; shacha, a savory sauce of garlic, shallots, chilis, and dried shrimp; fermented pineapple tepache mocktails; and muhammara, a spread/dip made with fermented bell peppers and walnuts.”Mediterranean flavors are gaining attention, says Gold Coast Ingredients’ Byrnes. “Mediterranean dishes have been trending in 2023 in prepared meals, sauces, and dips,” she says. “We are also seeing a rise in flavored hummus variations. Therefore, we predict the Mediterranean trend will influence new baklava-flavored protein and nutritional bars, allowing consumers to experience the taste of the mouthwatering honey, nut, phyllo dough treat.”Alcohol AssociationAlcohol-related flavors continue to get new life in nonalcoholic products, including zero-proof mojitos, bellinis, spritzers, and margaritas, notes Philip Caputo, marketing and consumer insights manager at Virginia Dare.“As people become more thoughtful about their alcohol consumption, they’re turning to zero-proof alternatives to provide the same experience of a craft cocktail without the buzz,” says Caputo. “Zero-proof applications can faithfully recreate the flavors in a daiquiri or make a premium drink reminiscent of a cocktail or aperitif with layered notes. Then you can enjoy a crisp persimmon elderflower mocktail with fragrant notes of clove.”He adds, “A crafted experience means people won’t feel like they’re missing out on the drinking experience at parties or relaxing after a hectic day.”At Gold Coast Ingredients, Marketing Manager Megan Byrnes reports that “Cocktail-inspired flavors have aided in innovating the nutraceutical industry with flavors such as mango margarita, watermelon mojito, and strawberry daiquiri. We foresee new mocktail blends with alternative fruits and fusion flowers like passion fruit pina colada, raspberry mojito, and blood orange mule.”Another trend? “Espresso martinis are standing out at restaurants and bars across the nation,” she adds. “Get ready to see espresso martini as an innovative flavor in supplements, bakery, and confectionery.”There’s also the social element associated with alcohol consumption. “In 2024, [brands] can help people who crave connection by developing shareable products like large-format, ready-to-serve cocktails,” predicts Lisa Jackson, director of marketing for FlavorSum. “Shareable foods also give people the opportunity of adventurous eating and delight in new flavors or ingredients.”Some consumers find flavors that remind them of a particular locale comforting, Flavorchem’s report notes. “Comfort-seeking consumers are exploring hearty stews, savory soups, and cooked cheeses with unique, regional ingredients.”Consumers are simply growing more adventurous, period. Their thirst for the new and novel will continue to spur unexpected product launches.“In 2024, taste exploration will continue, whether through discovering new global cuisines or the infusion of what would be a traditional savory flavor into sweet categories,” says Lyons at Sensient Flavors & Extracts. For instance, “With the rising popularity of Filipino cuisine, flavors like pandan and ube will continue to grow, possibly extending into the creation of an ube savory dish. With the resurgence of gin in the beverage category, we may see it expand into other categories, like a Gin 1000 Island salad dressing, bringing new life to an otherwise mainstream product.”And space exploration will inspire new launches that let consumers “escape to the future,” predicts Byrnes. “2024 will bring us more sci-fi and futuristic flavors,” she says. “In 2024, prepare to find more galaxy- and space-themed products with colorful, fruity flavor combinations, including red raspberry, dark cherry, blackberry, and blue raspberry.”Indulge MeAnother 2024 trend will be indulgent flavors. “Rich umami flavors like truffle oil, tinned fish, and aged parmesan cheese are incredibly indulgent, making daily eating and drinking into an occasion,” notes ADM’s Zhou. “Pairing umami with sweet presents a decadent sensory experience, like maple syrup and smoky bacon, miso banana bread, hoisin-glazed meatballs, and black garlic and sun-ripened bruschetta. Amaretto affogato is another little luxury, uniting bitter with sweet, frothy with smooth, and hot with cold.”Flavorchem’s 2024 Flavor & Trend Forecast notes that “Bold, umami-rich flavors have witnessed 66% growth on U.S. menus since 2019, delivering depth to familiar dishes.”Gourmet flavors are a treat, says Massumoto at Synergy Flavors. “A developing movement to brand chef-inspired or gourmet ingredients and flavors at a premium price point in the form of ‘pro’ or ‘premium’ lines aims to help brands distinguish their offerings from a sea of niche and fragmented companies,” he says. “Luxury includes premium flavors like speculoos biscuit heaven, white chocolate raspberry swirl, and blueberry cheesecake riot.”The element of surprise can even be a treat in itself. “Brands often turn to indulgent flavor combinations to deliver surprise,” says FlavorSum’s Jackson. “We expect unexpected pairings to build in 2024, like lemon-lime paired with white chocolate in bakery, or snacks featuring hot honey combined with butter toffee.”“Wholesome, simple combinations like vanilla-apricot or strawberry-lemonade can also delight with the reassurance of naturalness,” she adds.Tapping into EmotionsThe goal for food, drink, and supplement formulators in 2024 will be to continue offering flavors that shoppers connect with emotionally and personally.“Beyond being delicious, these flavor categories fulfill consumers’ need for connection, sophistication, or lifestyle changes,” says Virginia Dare’s Caputo. “Flavor can transport us to the past or make us feel like an adult. Beyond tasting good, flavors can fulfill emotional and functional needs, which is what’s driving these trends.”Recent VideosRelated Content AdvertisementU.S. Hemp Roundtable petitions for temporary restraining order against California’s emergency hemp regulationsSebastian KrawiecOctober 4th 2024ArticleThe temporary restraining order would prevent the enforcement of these regulations while the lawsuit is being litigated.Funtrition and Sofgen to showcase innovative gummy and softgel solutions at SupplySide West 2024 Erin McEvoyOctober 3rd 2024ArticleThe two companies have been expanding their operations and technology to meet the needs of the global nutraceutical industry.New ingredients will be featured by PLT Health Solutions at SupplySide West 2024Erin McEvoyOctober 1st 2024ArticleThe ingredients developer will also be highlighting new clinical science and delivery system options.Senator Rand Paul introduces HEMP Act, which would amend the definition of hempSebastian KrawiecSeptember 30th 2024ArticleThe bill would amend the definition of hemp to raise the threshold of delta-9 THC to 1% from 0.3%.

      "In addition, according to Varchasvi Singh, food service analyst with Mintel, the stereotype that American palates are “bland” is a misconception, and this trend proves it. \n",
      "“There certainly is an expanded appetite for spicy foods and flavors, one that is driven by wanting to explore unfamiliar ingredients and cuisines,” Singh told CNN. “This enthusiasm isn’t a fad, it is here to stay.”\n",
