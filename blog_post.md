**Sub-section 1: Notable Box Office Flops**

1. **Lisa Frankenstein** - Topping the list of 2024's flops is Focus Features’ horror romance film "Lisa Frankenstein." Despite its release in over 3,000 theaters, it grossed a mere $9.77 million in the U.S., with a critic score of 51% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film struggled to find an audience, possibly due to its niche genre and mixed reviews.

2. **Madame Web** - This superhero feature starring Sydney Sweeney and Dakota Johnson had a reported budget of $80 million but only grossed $43.82 million. Although it was poorly reviewed, the film surprisingly performed well on streaming platforms, highlighting a shift in audience viewing preferences.

3. **Argylle** - Despite a $200 million budget, Universal Pictures’ "Argylle" grossed only $45.21 million. The film's failure is attributed to a lack of compelling marketing and strong competition from other releases.
